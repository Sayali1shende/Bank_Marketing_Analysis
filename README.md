This project analyzes the Bank Marketing Dataset using Python to explore customer behavior and identify factors influencing term deposit subscriptions. It includes data cleaning, visualization, and insights to support better marketing decision-making.Overview
# Overview
This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Bank Marketing Dataset, aiming to understand customer behavior and determine factors influencing whether a client subscribes to a term deposit.
The analysis can help banks improve marketing strategies and target potential customers more effectively.
